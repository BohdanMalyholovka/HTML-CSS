    <span>The Brutale 675 and 800 three-cylinder have become the gateway to a new world of high-tech motorcycles for many
    riders with outstanding ride quality, power under constant control, lightness, great design and excellent quality at
    an affordable price.Today, the Brutale 800 Dragster is taking a huge step forward, into the future, but at the same
    time, it is doing it with an eye to the past, to the ideas underlying the first 4-cylinder Brutale, to the very
    essence of the "naked concept", and this is frank, neither with than incomparable, extreme and uncompromising,
    daring and memorable style. Connecting the past and the future, today, the Brutale 800 Dragster embodies the
    accumulated experience and knowledge, and symbolizes the motorcycle past, present and future. The real essence, real
    sensations and emotions, this is 100% Brutale.As with the Brutale 800, some of the exterior details of the MV Agusta
    Brutale Dragster 800RR have been redesigned, such as the tiny wing design, headlight, powerful fuel tank, plus a
    redesigned tail section. The passenger footpegs are now retracted for a cleaner look. Instead of two LED headlights,
    the rear brake light is represented by a single component, it looks very cool. The new rudder is adjustable in
    height and can be adjusted by any pilot for their own comfort.Fortunately, MV Agusta retained the aluminum arm
    guards and customized the Kineo spoke wheels wrapped in Pirelli tires. With wheels like this, the bike looks both
    fancy and a bit retro. A muscular look and a wicked stance is supported by an aluminum fuel tank. Its curves and
    lines are reminiscent of a person who shed liters of sweat over the years in the gym. The dashboard LCD is now
    housed in a new housing with aluminum components. The front fender of the MV Agusta Brutale Dragster 800RR is
    significantly shorter than that of the Brutale 800, its legs, like the tank cover, are made of aluminum.

    <p>Renowned and utilizing the most advanced Italian technology, this state-of-the-art MV Agusta inline 3-cylinder
        engine
        with its endless energy reserves needs no introduction. In fact, the MV Agusta lineup already had a motorcycle
        worthy of emulation and its already great settings just got better.Like any other RR model, the Dragster simply
        "has
        to" offer something more. And he did it ... the most powerful engine in its category, with a new version of 140
        hp.
        Like Superbike motorcycles, its maximum power is reached at 13,100 rpm, making the Brutale 800 Dragster RR
        uniquely
        attractive and out of reach of competitors in the same segment. Don't waste your time looking: the only bike
        you'll
        find another equally powerful 3-cylinder 800 cc engine is the MV Agusta F3 800.The engine found in the Brutale
        800
        Dragster RR is not derived from the F3 800, but is an evolution of the 3-cylinder block found in the Brutale 800
        and
        Brutale Dragster 800. To achieve 140 hp. at 13,100 rpm, the air box has been completely redesigned and the
        exhaust
        system has been optimized for greater efficiency. The new, improved hydraulic chain tensioner makes the engine
        even
        more reliable and even quieter. Changes have also been made to the electronic injection system, which now has a
        six-injector system, two per cylinder, instead of the single-injector system previously used on other Brutale
        models.In addition, the internal shape of the fuel tank was redesigned to provide the necessary additional
        space,
        while its external shape and appearance remained unchanged. As a result, the power output is linear at low
        engine
        rpm, while explosive at high rpm, allowing for a chic significant acceleration that ends at only 13,200 rpm when
        the
        limiter engages. Power is not the only characteristic that has increased significantly, as the torque has
        increased
        from 81 to 86 Nm. These numbers clearly illustrate the impressive performance of this updated MV Agusta
        3-cylinder
        engine.The created engine turned out to be light and compact as much as possible. It combines excellent racing
        performance and performance. The design engineers have perfectly coped with the tasks set before them when
        developing the engine for the MV Agusta Brutale 800 Dragster RR.To enhance dynamic performance and optimize
        weights,
        despite its volume and weighing only 52 kg, this in-line 3-cylinder engine features a counter-rotating
        crankshaft -
        a solution never seen before on standard production models. These are the characteristics that make this
        advanced
        engine the best example of the high level of development and outstanding craftsmanship of Italian engineers.The
        detachable, cassette-type, 6-speed gearbox is another solution borrowed from the world of racing. Specially
        designed
        to deliver stunning acceleration on the racetrack, it is extremely reliable and versatile in everyday use.
