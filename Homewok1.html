<h1>Design:</h1>
<p>The Brutale 675 and 800 three-cylinder have become the gateway to a new world of high-tech motorcycles for many
    riders with outstanding ride quality, power under constant control, lightness, great design and excellent quality at
    an affordable price.

<p>Today, the Brutale 800 Dragster is taking a huge step forward, into the future, but at the same
    time, it is doing it with an eye to the past, to the ideas underlying the first 4-cylinder Brutale, to the very
    essence of the "naked concept", and this is frank, neither with than incomparable, extreme and uncompromising,
    daring and memorable style. Connecting the past and the future, today, the Brutale 800 Dragster embodies the
    accumulated experience and knowledge, and symbolizes the motorcycle past, present and future. The real essence, real
    sensations and emotions, this is 100% Brutale.
